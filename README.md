> ### **Java 17 + Spring Boot 3 + Native image** codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.

### [Demo](https://demo.realworld.io/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with ****Java 17 + Spring Boot 3 running as a native application**** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

This application is based on [Java 17 + Spring Boot 3 Real world application](https://github.com/shirohoo/realworld-java17-springboot3) with changes made only to make it working as a native application

```

## Run application with native-image-agent attached to collect reachability metadata

```shell
java -agentlib:native-image-agent=config-output-dir=./aot/META-INF/native-image/,experimental-class-define-support -Dspring.aot.enabled=true -jar ./build/libs/realworld.jar
```

## In second terminal window run api integration tests

```shell
